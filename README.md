Elder Scrolls Online AddOn

unfortunately i have stopped playing elder scrolls online and won't be updating my addons.
i only played battlegrounds and the desync issues + huge meta changes each patch have caused me to focus my time on other things.
eso's pvp was incredible, so if the devs come out with a new game on a new engine i'll be first in line to play! :)
